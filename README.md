# Git Lesson

This lesson covers the basics of using git for version control.

This lesson is for the first day of the MSSE bootcamp.

To make a commit ("version" or "checkpoint") of your files:

1. Make changes to your project
2. Tell git which files to include in next checkpoint using 'git add filename'
3. Create a checkpoint using "git commit -m 'message about what you did'"

## Adding Features
Features should be developed on branches. To create and switch to a brancg, use the command

'git switch -c new_branch_name'

git switch to an existing branch, use

'git switch branch_name'

I added this from GitHub!
